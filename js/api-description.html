<h2>Inner Gerbil</h2>
<p>
  Core RESTful API for building mutual credit systems, 
  time banks (a special case of mutual credit system), 
  and knowledge banks.
</p><p>
  It allows for the creation of various user interfaces 
  (for : web, desktop, mobile devices. or for : end user, administrative users, analysis purposes, etc..)
  that are all in sync with each other.
</p><p>  
  It is designed to supports many groups, wich can choose to have subgroups (recursively) or not. 
  These groups can choose to participate in (one of possibly many) larger communities (<em>connector groups</em>)
  for exchanging currency / knowledge, or they can choose to remain closed groups.
  
  If they do participate in one or more larger communities, such a <em>connector group</em> and it's member groups can impose 
  restrictions on the exchanges of currency and knowledge, with a variety of strategies.
</p><p>  
  User can, at all times, join multiple (unrelated) groups and still see a single
  consistent view of all messages, transactions, etc..
